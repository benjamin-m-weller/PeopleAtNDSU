# PeopleAtNDSU
This project was intented to be used for cross referencing the NDSU deans list, class rosters and the NDSU phonebook. I indended it to be used for finding people that were of a similar mindset as myself.

This project was completed over winter break following my first semester of my Computer Science undergrad. I had no clue about data structures or how to optimize for run-time, needless to say I made a functional program that met my needs.
